Need monthly, CMOR-like files for e.g. historical (1850-2014) for variables:
ts, tas, pr, tauu

as well as land-sea mask
sftlf_*

# Run ENSO metrics packages with this (need to edit for model name/resolution)
run_enso_pmp.sh

It calls (contains lots of paths)
pmp_metrics_enso.py

and uses this configuration file (which contains the template path to the model data)
basic_enso_param_MO_model.py.in


Code
convert_pp_to_cmorish.py

is some code to convert pp to (close-to) CMOR format which seems to work with PMP.
